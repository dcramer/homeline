# homeline

Homeline is an MQTT-based solution for integrating your connected home devices into your smart home automation software. Instead of maintaining automation-specific integrations, homeline gives you a bridge which can work with any solution (Home Assistant, Homebridge, etc) with a simple and stable base backed by an MQTT broker.
